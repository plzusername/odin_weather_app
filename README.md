# odin_weather_app

## Introduction

Hello and welcome, to my latest(and not so overengineered) project, the weather(or not) app! This project was a great opportunity to practice my API and dev environment skills, although I did definently forgo spending a lot of time improving code quality for the sake of speed, it was nevertheless a great learning experience and a nice oppurtunity to take a break from learning and build something nice and quick!

## Main topics learnt

- Linters
- vscode setting.json configuration
- babel with webpack
- Promises
- API's
- await async
- setting up developer environment

## Deployment

```bash
git clone git@github.com:plzusername/odin_weather_app.git

cd odin_weather_app```
